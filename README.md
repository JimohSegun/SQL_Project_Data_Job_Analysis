# Introduction 
This project delves into the data job market with a focus on the data analyst role, exploring top-paying positions, in-demand skills, and areas where high demand aligns with high salaries in data analytics.

# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to identify top-paying and in-demand skills, leveraging others' work to find the optimal skill set.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are the most in-demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. what are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights, ideal for handling job posting data.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Analysis
Each query for this project was designed to investigate specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here is how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high-paying opportunities in the field.
~~~sql
SELECT 
       job_posted_date
       job_id, 
       job_title,
	   job_location,
	   salary_year_avg,
       job_schedule_type,
	   name as company_name
FROM  
      sql_course.dbo.job_posting as post
Left Join  sql_course.dbo.company_dim as dim 
ON post.company_id = dim.company_id
Where 
      job_title = 'Data Analyst'AND
      job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
	  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY  
        salary_year_avg DESC
 ~~~       

### 2. Skills Required For Top Paying Jobs
To better understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insight into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

~~~sql
WITH Top_paying_jobs as (
  SELECT 
        top 10 job_id, 
       job_title,
	   salary_year_avg,
	   name as company_name	
FROM  
      sql_course.dbo.job_posting as post
Left Join  sql_course.dbo.company_dim as dim 
ON post.company_id = dim.company_id
Where 
      job_title = 'Data Analyst'AND
      job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
	  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
)
  
SELECT 
      Top_paying_jobs.* , skills
FROM  
      top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN sql_course.dbo.skills_job_dim 
 ON  
     skills_job_dim .job_id = Top_paying_jobs.job_id
INNER JOIN sql_course.dbo.skills
 ON 
     skills.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
     salary_year_avg

~~~

ON  
       skills_job_dim .job_id = job_posting.job_id
INNER JOIN sql_course.dbo.skills
ON   
       skills.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
       job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY skills, 
       job_title_short 
ORDER BY Demand_count DESC
~~~


Here is the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts:

- **SQL and Excel remain fundamental**, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing.

### 4. Skills Based On Salary 
Exploring the average salaries assocaited with different skills revealed which skills are highest paying 
~~~sql
SELECT  
        TOP 20 skills ,
        AVG(cast (salary_year_avg as float)) as avg_salary
FROM 
        sql_course.dbo.job_posting
INNER JOIN sql_course.dbo.skills_job_dim
